Read:

Read pages 100 through 144 of chapter 3 of the JavaScript & jQuery book.

Focus on these pages, reading slowly and carefully. Read and be familiar with the rest of chapter 3, but don't feel like you need to understand it all perfectly.

Reflect:

What's an Object?
What is an object method?

What is the difference between and object property and a variable?
What is meant by object key/value pair?
What are the two ways to access an object property?

After writing your reflection, you'll be able to read and reply to your classmates' reflections as well.
