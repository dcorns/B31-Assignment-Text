All Bootcamp students are required to attend the "Unix & Git for Everyone" Workshop as a prerequisite to this course. https://www.codefellows.org/courses/workshops/unix-and-git

OR

If you are already familiar with Git and Unix, you can test-out by brushing up on your skills on your own, and completing the same work independently:

Start by reading through the Assignment section. Then, follow the Pre-work steps (1, 2, and 3). Finally, closely follow along with the instructions in the Assignment section.

EITHER WAY:

Submit a link to your PR (pull request) as completion of this assignment. Comment on your submission with:
1) How much time this assignment took you, and how you spent it, and
2) your observations about git (I'd love to hear your most and least favorite things about git).

This is very similar to how most assignments in this course will be submitted, with a link to a pull request. Work out the kinks in your git-fu now! :-)
