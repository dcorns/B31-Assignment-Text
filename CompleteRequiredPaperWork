Please print out, fill in, and sign these documents. Turn them in on the first day of class. Hand them to a TA, your instructor, or other Code Fellows staff.

After you have printed, read, and signed the documents, write below a complete sentence of whether or not you agree to follow the honor code. (I agree to comply with the Code Fellows honor code.)
