Hi there! Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with Canvas. Start by watching this overview video (4 min) and any of these others that look interesting to you. Then just poke around and explore a little.

Once you've gotten the hang of it, there are a few key settings that are important for you to adjust right away.

1. Click on Settings, in the top right of Canvas. Then, click on the Edit Settings button on the right. Make sure your timezone is set to Pacific time. This is important because the default is Mountain Time (which will mess up your calendar and assignment submission dates).

2. Add your complete name, and other full contact information. Please include backup email (if you have one), and a phone number (useful in case of emergency).

3. Add a picture of your face. Not your cat, pet llama, or a Klingon. Add a nice head-shot so that we can learn your names faster and give you better feedback on assignments.

4. Click on Notifications and make sure everything is set to ASAP. Because of the compressed time frame of this course we've found that setting all notifications to ASAP is the best way to ensure that you are promptly notified when changes occur.

Please use the text field below to confirm the completion of these steps, and let us know if you have any questions about using Canvas.
