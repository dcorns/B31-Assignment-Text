Do your own research to learn more CSS properties for transforms, transistions, and animations. Now, apply these techniques to your own donut shop program.

Before writing a single line of code, create and checkout a branch called animate. Use this branch to commit all of your changes.

Animate your page:

Add some delight to your donut shop page. Have fun with it!

Animate the elements of your donut shop:
1) Implement a CSS transform.
2) Implement a CSS transition.
3) Implement a CSS animation.
4) Once you have completed these requirements, continue to add as many as you desire.
5) Push your local animate branch to origin. (GitHub)
6) On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the animate branch to the master branch.
7) Review and accept that Pull Request.
8) Pull down the origin's master branch to your local master branch.
