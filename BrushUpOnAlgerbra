You don't need to read through each topic, but you should have familiarity with most of them. You should have good familiarity with exponents and polynomials, and be sure to read the sections on Functions and Logarithms, as well as any others that look interesting to you.

For your assignment submission, please report what you have learned. For example, share an observation about what you read, and/or a well-formed question about something you'd like answered.
