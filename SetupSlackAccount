Slack is a very nice chat program that will let you communicate directly with classmates, instructors, and TAs.

Go to codefellows.slack.com and configure your account.

To help us get to know each other a little better:

Complete your profile, including your full name.
Ensure your profile picture is a clear image of your face (not your dog, not you with a bestie, not you off in the distance).
Send a message in our class channel (#sea-b31-foundations), with a brief intro, and what technology stacks (Rails, JS, Python, iOS, Front-End, other) you are most interested in pursuing.
See you in Slack, and in class soon!
