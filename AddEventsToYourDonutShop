In class, you learned how to listen for and handle user events in the browser. Now, it's your turn to add these techniques to your donut shop program.

Before writing a single line of code, create and checkout a branch called events. Use this branch to commit all of your changes.

Listen for and handle events:

For this assignment, you're not allowed to use the prompt() function or jQuery.
Imagine a scenario where a user would like add new locations to the table.

1) Add input tags for the following location attributes.
    Location name
    Minimum customers per hour
    Maximum customers per hour
    Average donuts purchased per customer

2) Then add a button tag that saves the location in the following manner.
    Creates a new DonutShop object with the user supplied data from the input tags.
    Appends a row to the table using the new object's hourly and daily donut totals.

3) Once you've figured out how to add a new location, try using the same HTML elements to update an existing location.
    Here is a tip: Use an Array to hold your DonutShop objects.

4) Once you've figured out how to update an existing location, try implementing a few event-based easter eggs. (hidden/undocumented surprises)

5) Update your GitHub repository
    Push your local events branch to your origin's events branch.
    On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the events branch to the master branch.
    Review and accept that Pull Request.
    Pull down the origin's master branch to your local master branch.

Submitting your work:
    Submit the link to your Pull Request to this Canvas assignment.
    Add a comment to your Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.
