Reflection:

To help you reflect on these topics, describe in your own words:

What is the DOM, anyway?
Why is the DOM useful to programmers?
How might you manipulate the DOM in your guessing game?
How could you use a given element object from the DOM to access the attributes of its parent object.
What is the path object of the DOM event object, and how could you use it?
Why would it be a bad idea to create a global variable called document in your programs?
After writing your reflection, you'll be able to read and reply to your classmates' reflections as well.
