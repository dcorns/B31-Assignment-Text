In class, you learned various CSS properties for laying out content in a webpage. Now, it's your turn to improve the layout of your own donut shop program.

Before writing a single line of code, create and checkout a branch called layout. Use this branch to commit all of your changes.

Layout your page:
Start by sketching out, on paper, how you want your webpage to look.
Add more content if needed. Instructions, more images, marketing copy, or lorem ipsum if you like, to ensure your page has a few different sections.
Do not use a grid system. Practice using the fundamental layout properties first.

1) Add either a fixed width or fluid width layout to your web page.
2) Extend your donut shop program with the following CSS components:
    An element that uses fixed positioning
    An element that uses absolute positioning
    An element that uses relative positioning
3) Synchronize your local and GitHub repositories.
    Push your local layout branch to your origin's layout branch.
    On GitHub, create a Pull Request from the layout branch to the master branch.
    Review and accept that Pull Request.
    Pull down the origin's master branch to your local master branch.

Submitting your work:
1) Submit the link to your Pull Request to this Canvas assignment.
2) Identify which elements are using the different types of positioning.
3) Add a comment to your Canvas submission with answers to the following questions.
    How long did this assignment take you?
    What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned?

(This submission flow should be getting more comfortable to you. Keep working with instructors/TAs to work out the kinks.)
