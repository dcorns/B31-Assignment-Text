Since this course is longer, it graded in 3 separate parts, worth 10 points each.

Work your way through as much of the entire course as you can. If you get stuck in any given lesson, move on to the next lesson, and keep yourself moving!

Make a submission when you've completed each one of the 3 separate parts. Submit a link to a screen shot image of the completion page showing your achievements. It should clearly show the check marks next to the sections that you complete. (if you are not sure how to get an image online try google drive https://www.google.com/drive/)  Use command (or equivalent) with the minus key ("-") to make more fit on your screen if needed.

Create a comment on your submission with 1) the amount of time this took you and how you spent it , and 2) your observations and 3) questions from this assignment.
